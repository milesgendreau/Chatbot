COLD OPEN

INT. PAWNEE TODAY STUDIOS - DAY 1

LESLIE is acting out a PSA on a mostly-bare stage.

LESLIE
“Safe Halloween” PSA, take one. (to cameras)
Hey, kids! The Parks Department wants you to have fun on Halloween. But we also believe that “trick 
or treat” doesn’t have to mean “sick or hurt.”
(trying to make it rhyme) “Sick or hur-eeet.” Rhymes with
“treat.” Okay. Let’s watch this skit I’ve written, and copyrighted, about Halloween safety.

JERRY, APRIL, and TOM walk on stage. Tom and April are playing trick-or-treaters, Leslie is their 
mom.

TOM
“Hey, Diane. Don’t you love Halloween, especially when we act responsibly?”

APRIL
“Yes, Jeremy. I do.”

LESLIE
“Okay, kids. Just one more house, and then it’s time to go home.”

Tom realizes something. Looks at Leslie.

TOM
Mommy? Why do I look so different from you? And my sister?

LESLIE
(hushed)
Stick to the script.

TOM
I can’t when I’m so confused about who I am. I need my backstory, for the character of “Jeremy.”

LESLIE
(takes deep breath)
Okay, um... Diane’s father, my first husband, passed away, in a war.

LESLIE (CONT'D)
And then I married your father, who’s Libyan.

APRIL
My dad died? You said he was training to be an astronaut!

LESLIE
Just... back on script! Both of you! (calling off)
We can edit this all out, right, Billy?

An EXTRA off-camera nods, bored. They ring a doorbell.

TOM/APRIL
Trick or treat.

JERRY
Hello, kids! Do you want some candy?

APRIL
No. I’m too sad. I just found out my dad is dead.

JERRY
(at a loss)
...Okay. Well. Here’s some candy.

He hands them a CANDY BAR with a GIANT BLADE sticking out of it. Tom has clearly never seen this 
prop before and LAUGHS.

TOM
Whoa! What’s up, Creepsville? Did you lose your machete? Because there’s a machete sticking out of 
this Kit Kat.

APRIL
What are you talking about, Jeremy? I don’t see anything wrong with that.
I’m going to eat it.

JERRY
(improvising; creepy) Yesssssss... eat it!

LESLIE
God Jerry, don’t be such a ham. (re: candy bar)
We’d better just throw this away and report the incident to the police.

So kids, what did we learn?

TOM
(to camera)
If you want to hide a sharp object in candy, make sure you use a small blade.



No.

APRIL
(big smile)
Or use poison!

LESLIE
Stop it.

ACT ONE

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER - D1

Leslie stands in the hallway, arms folded, calmly looking for someone as KIDS filter past her. 
Suddenly she sees him: GREG PIKITIS. 16. Ultra-cocky. Leslie’s worst nightmare.

LESLIE
Greg Pikitis.

He looks over, smirks, walks up to her. He’s eating a PEACH.

GREG
You’re the Parks lady, right?

LESLIE
That’s right. I’m the Parks lady. Leslie Knope. And I’m here to tell you that this year, it ends.

GREG
What ends?

LESLIE
The statue, Greg. I’ve got the entire Parks Department watching you, and my boyfriend’s a cop, so 
don’t even try it.

GREG
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

LESLIE
I think you do. It ends today, Pikitis. It ends. To. Day.

She walks off.

GREG
Thanks for dropping by, Leslie. You look great.

LESLIE
(happy) Thank you.
(serious) Ends today.

He smirks again and takes a bite of the peach.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

LESLIE
Ugh, this kid. We have a history, Greg and I. He absolutely terrorizes the parks system.

B-roll: Greg duct tapes a kid to a playground merry-go-round and spins him around. Leslie chases 
him around the ride as he keeps spinning it.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Every Halloween, someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.

B-roll: A STATUE of a Founding Father type in a park.

LESLIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I know it’s Greg Pikitis, but I can never prove it. He’s like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond 
supervillain criminal mastermind.
(beat)
Or maybe somebody else is doing it, but I really think it’s him.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1

ANN walks in and sees April, Jerry, DONNA, and RON. She looks around a little and sees that Tom 
isn’t there.

ANN
Hey, Parks Department. Just reminding you all -- seven o’clock, in costume, my place. Everybody in?

General assent. ANN TALKING HEAD
ANN
I called in a favor and got out of my shift -- being an ER nurse on Halloween is the worst.
(to camera)
People: I don’t care how accurate you want to make your “Legolas” costume -- don’t use a real 
sword.

ANN
One more thing -- the people in this room, now, are the people I invited, so... just, don’t tell 
anyone else.

APRIL
(looking around) Who isn’t h--

Tom walks in.

TOM
Hey! What’s going on, cupcake?

ANN
(camera aware) Nothing. How are you?

TOM
Doing good. Excited about the party tonight.

ANN
(glancing to camera)
Oh... you’re coming? Great. I was just about to tell you about that.

TOM
Jerry already told me. Can’t wait to see how small your costume is. What time does it start?

Ann glares at Jerry, who tries to hide his face.

ANN

Seven. Perfect.
TOM ANN
Yes. Perfect.

EXT. COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER - D1

Leslie sits at the table working on something as three MAINTENANCE GUYS put up Halloween 
decorations in the courtyard. Ann sits with her.

ANN
I’ll be so sad if you’re not there.

Table Draft                 09/29/09

LESLIE
I’ll come as soon as I can. But I have a full night of crime prevention ahead of me. Check it out.

She holds up what she’s been working on -- a MAP of the city with lots of ARROWS and MARKINGS and 
PATHS marked out.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Every possible way Greg Pikitis can get from his house to the statue.

ANN
That looks like something you’d find on the wall of a serial killer.

Leslie mulls that over.

LESLIE
In a way, that’s a compliment. Shows dedication.

ANN
Is it really that big a deal? So this kid TP’s some statue.

LESLIE
And all the trees, and all the benches. It takes us like ten days to clean his mess up. But more 
importantly: Pikitis sucks, and I want to destroy him.

ANN
Well, if you destroy him early, please come by.

LESLIE
I will.

Ann heads off. Leslie yells at a MAINTENANCE WORKER.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Hey! How is anyone going to be able to walk through the door?

Camera shows a MASSIVE GOB OF FAKE COBWEBS covering the entire entryway to the courtyard.

MAINTENANCE WORKER
Oh.

Jerry, not looking, WALKS INTO THE COBWEB and SCREAMS. Leslie RUSHES OVER and helps him.

EXT. PARK - EARLY EVENING - NIGHT 1

Leslie stands at the statue of MAYOR PERCY with DAVE and ANDY. Andy has his GUITAR CASE.

LESLIE
William Percy. One of Pawnee’s greatest mayors. And a true hero -- during the Pawnee Bread Factory 
fire of 1922, he rushed back into the burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for 
Pawnee Pumpernickel!

DAVE
Didn’t like thirty people die in that fire?

LESLIE
(shrugs)
He wasn’t Superman.

ANDY
He looks like a walrus, kind of.

LESLIE
Okay. Andy. Tonight, I am officially putting you on the Parks Department payroll. Eight dollars an 
hour.

ANDY
Whoo!

She hands him a picture of Greg Pikitis.

LESLIE
Commit this to memory, then burn it. Don’t burn it -- that’s insane. Keep it. You see this kid, you 
stop him. Knock his head off if you have to.

DAVE
Don’t do that.

LESLIE
Don’t do that. But you have my permission to use excessive force.

DAVE
Don’t use excessive force.

Table Draft                 09/29/09

LESLIE
Don’t go overboard. But stop him. (quietly)
By any means necessary.

DAVE
No.

LESLIE
No. Just stop him.

Leslie gives him a look: “Use excessive force.” He nods. ANDY TALKING HEAD
At the statue.

ANDY
A week ago, I had nothing. Now I got a part-time job, and tonight I’m gonna make thirty-two bucks. 
I owe Leslie everything I have.
(beat)
Which, after tonight, will be thirty- nine bucks.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Ann, dressed as RAGGEDY ANN, rushes around putting the finishing touches on her place. It’s very 
well decorated. “MONSTER MASH” is playing from her stereo.

The DOORBELL RINGS. It’s RON, dressed as a PIRATE.

RON
Hello, Ann. Am I early?

ANN
Right on time. Come on in.

RON
I like your costume.

ANN
Raggedy Ann. It was my favorite book when I was a kid. I’m named after her.


Beat.




Beat.


RON
I’m a pirate.

ANN
So, there’s food over there--

RON
(a little too loud and eager)
Is there bacon wrapped shrimp? By any chance?

ANN
No. Oh -- you love that, don’t you? I’m sorry. There’s candy...

Ron looks crushed. DR. HARRIS enters, dressed like a doctor.

ANN (CONT’D)
Hey, Dr. Harris!

DR. HARRIS
Ann.

ANN
Come on in. This is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department -- I know him from that thing I’m doing. 
This is Dr. Harris, from my hospital.

They shake.

RON
You’re a doctor.

DR. HARRIS
Yup.

RON
I meant, your costume.

DR. HARRIS
I got it. Pirate?

Ron nods. Beat. Awkwardness.

ANN
I’m going to check on the...

She’s got nothing. Walks off. ANN TALKING HEAD
From her kitchen, with the two guys in the b.g.

ANN
Worlds colliding. Always awkward.

INT. LESLIE’S CAR - LATER - N1

Leslie and Dave are watching through the windshield as GREG and some FRIENDS hang out in a parking 
lot, skateboarding.

LESLIE
(into a recorder)
8:22 PM. Suspect still with friends in 7-Eleven parking lot. Looks obnoxious and irritating, even 
at a great distance.

DAVE
How long are we gonna follow this kid?

LESLIE
All night, if we have to.

DAVE
I was kind of hoping we could go to Ann’s party. That’s why I traded shifts.

LESLIE
This is kind of like a party. Here -- I’ll put on some music.

She hits a button on the stereo. SPOOKY GHOST SOUNDS start playing -- chains rattling, etc.

DAVE
This is the CD you have in?

LESLIE
It’s Halloween! What do you want, Christmas music?
(into recorder)
Suspect is laughing with friends in a snide, turdish manner.

DAVE
“Turdish?”

LESLIE
Yes. Like a turd -- like a little turd.

She puts down her binoculars. DAVE TALKING HEAD
Outside the car.

Table Draft                 09/29/09

DAVE
I called in a ton of favors and got out of my shift so I wouldn’t have to spend the night chasing 
after little punk kids who are out to cause trouble. Then Leslie called and said, “Hey, can you 
help me with something?”

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

There are a few more PEOPLE in the house, but the party is pretty quiet. LAME HALLOWEEN SONGS are 
still playing.

APRIL, DEREK, and BEN enter. She’s a HAPPY CLOWN with a big smiley face. Ben is also a PIRATE, but 
it’s WAY MORE ELABORATE than Ron’s costume. Derek is wearing a button-down shirt and tan pants.

ANN
Hey, guys!

APRIL
Hey. You remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?

ANN
Yeah, hi.
(to Derek)
It’s totally fine that you didn’t wear a costume.

DEREK
I did. I’m a straight person.

MARK enters holding a bag with his costume in it. He’s wearing exactly the same outfit as Derek.

MARK

Hey, honey. See?
DEREK MARK
Gotta change. Be right back.

He disappears.

ANN
Come on in. Sorry it’s kind of lame right now.

APRIL
That’s cool. I’m kind of into lame stuff in an ironic way right now. I’m going to a botanical 
garden tomorrow.

APRIL TALKING HEAD

APRIL
This Halloween party is dressed up as a funeral.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - N1

Ann and Mark. He’s now dressed as an Indiana Pacer.

ANN
I spent the entire day decorating this whole house, and everyone just hangs out in the kitchen. Why 
do people always just hang out in the kitchen?!

In the b.g. we see that literally everyone is in the kitchen.

MARK
It’s going fine.

ANN
It’s a little quiet. And all the nurses and doctors are just dressed as nurses and doctors. That’s 
so lame.

Camera sees, in the kitchen, a bunch of NURSES and DOCTORS in their usual work gear.

ANN (CONT'D)
Oh my God -- this party is flailing. Ron approaches with a fistful of Almond Joys.
RON
Ann, do you have any Mounds? All I see are Almond Joys, and I hate those.

Ann rubs her head.

INT. LESLIE’S CAR - LATER - N1

They are still watching Greg and his friends.

LESLIE
Can’t we just go rough him up a little?

DAVE
He’s not doing anything.

LESLIE
C’mon. We can do whatever we want. We’re cops.

DAVE
“We” are not cops.

LESLIE
Deputize me!

DAVE
Look -- your scare tactics clearly worked. You’ve got Andy guarding the statue. Let’s go to the 
party.

Leslie thinks. She puts the car in drive...

LESLIE
Fine. I have to stop by City Hall -- my costume is in my office. Just... fire a warning shot over 
his head as we drive by.

INT. PIONEER HALLWAY - LATER - N1

Dave and Leslie near the door. Leslie searches in her purse.

LESLIE
Ugh -- where are my keys?

DAVE
Looks like it’s open.

LESLIE
Really?

Leslie, confused, walks through the open door, and... INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - 
N1
...She FREEZES.

REVEAL: the entire department has been VANDALIZED. Toilet paper everywhere. Silly string. SPRAY 
PAINT on the walls that reads: “HAPPY HALLOWEEN, SUCKAZ.”

LESLIE
Pikitis!

ACT TWO

INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - N1

Leslie RUSHES to her office. It’s been hit too -- silly string, MOUSTACHES drawn on all the 
pictures of famous women. Spray-painted on the wall is “Crappy Halloweiners!”

DAVE
(rushing in behind her) Who did this?

LESLIE
It’s that kid! I told you!

Leslie looks around... sees something on her desk...

DAVE
Leslie, we tailed him for the last two hours. There must be another kid who hates you.

LESLIE
(staring at her desk) It was Pikitis.

She holds up a PEACH PIT that was lying on the desk.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(super dramatic) Believe me now?

DAVE
...That means nothing to me.

LESLIE
He was eating a peach when I went to talk to him! This is his ace of spades! It’s still warm. Now 
go arrest him!
(holds up pit)
And send this to the lab!

DAVE
We don’t have a lab. INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1
Mark and Ann are talking awkwardly to a nurse, PAULA. Paula is very severe.

PAULA
So you’re the Mark that Ann is dating.

MARK
I suppose I am.

PAULA
We’re very protective of Ann. We look out for her. You mess with one of us, you mess with all of 
us.

MARK
I don’t want to mess with anyone, for any reason.

PAULA
Nurses look out for each other.

MARK
Well... you guys kind of dropped the ball with Andy, huh?

Paula instantly softens.

PAULA
Awwww... Andy! I loved Andy. Such a sweetheart.
(to Ann)
Where’s Andy? Is he coming tonight? You should get back with Andy.

Mark sips a beer, awkwardly. Ann cringes a little.

ANN
Who needs a drink?

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - N1

She heads to the bar and looks around: people look bored. April walks up.

ANN
Hey, April. You having a good time?

APRIL
Derek broke up with me. He said he wants to focus more on his boyfriend. But that’s just what you 
say when you want to blow off your girlfriend.

April swigs directly from a bottle of gin.

ANN
You’re... underage.

Dr. Harris approaches.

DR. HARRIS
Yeah, I’m gonna leave.

ANN
Oh. Okay.

DR. HARRIS
This isn’t that fun.

ANN
Didn’t need to tell me that.

He holds up a full bottle of wine.

DR. HARRIS
I’m gonna take this home. Nobody was drinking it, so I’m gonna take it.

He takes a book off her shelf.

DR. HARRIS (CONT’D)
I’m gonna take this too. I’ve been meaning to read this.

Ann sighs.

INT. CITY HALL - SECURITY DESK - LATER - N1

Leslie and Dave are watching SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE with BILL, the night guard. It’s just shots of 
the hallway.

LESLIE
Okay, freeze it! Right there!

Bill hits pause. There is a MAN in the hallway.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Enhance!
(off his look) Enhance! Enhance image!

BILL
It’s just a VCR--

LESLIE
Enhance! Rotate!

Another COP comes in with GREG in tow. Greg looks around.

GREG
Whoa. What happened here?

LESLIE
Greg Pikitis. Let’s chat. (to cop)
Bring him to Interrogation Room 1. (no response)
The conference room, with the deer mural.

The cop leads Greg off.

DAVE
Listen -- this isn’t strictly “legal.” I can give you about an hour to talk to him, and then I have 
to let him go.

LESLIE
You talk to him first. A real cop should put the fear of God into him.
(hands him a pair of pliers) Here. Use these.

DAVE
What?

LESLIE
Just as props. Or on his fingernails.

DAVE
Why don’t I just talk to him?

LESLIE
(shrugs)
Okay. Do it the hard way.

DAVE TALKING HEAD

DAVE
Leslie is very smart, she’s an extremely high-energy individual, and her hair has an appealing 
color. But I’m glad she isn’t a cop. I would feel very unsafe, living in any city that she is a cop 
of.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - N1

Dave sits down across from Greg, who looks pretty calm. Leslie stands outside and watches through 
the window.

GREG
Why am I here? What is this place?

DAVE
This is the Parks Department. Someone vandalized it tonight and we have reason to believe it was 
you.

GREG
Well, it wasn’t. I’ve never been here before.

DAVE
Son, I’m a police officer. You shouldn’t lie to me.

GREG
I’m not. And why would I do this?

DAVE
Because you’ve had run-ins with Ms. Knope in the past.

Dave’s PHONE RINGS.

DAVE (CONT’D)
Hold on a minute. (into phone)
Yeah.

LESLIE (V.O.)
(on phone)
Ask him about the peach pit!

Greg looks over at Leslie, watching through the window and talking on her phone, while holding the 
peach pit.

GREG
This isn’t one-way glass, you know. I can see you. You’re right there.

Leslie suddenly gets self-conscious, and walks to her office. INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - A

Yes. And I have about forty-five minutes to prove it.

Well, the statue is fine. So I still get paid, right? Silver lining.

Leslie frowns.

LESLIE
(to her computer)
Come on! This is total b.s.!

ANDY
What are you reading?

LESLIE
The Geneva Convention.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

LESLIE
Torture is a very dicey subject. Jack Bauer can torture people because he’s always right. If he 
were wrong, he’d just be a crazy guy who hooks wires up to people’s nipples. And the show would be 
called “Crazy Wire Nipple Torture Man.” Or maybe “Dexter.” But I know I’m right.
(beat)
I think I’m right.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER - N1

Greg and Dave.

GREG
So. You and Knope, huh?

DAVE
Excuse me?

GREG
She said her boyfriend was a cop. Are you her boyfriend?

DAVE
That’s not... relevant.

GREG
Just want to say: nice pull.

Thank you, but that’s not appropriate. But thank you.

GREG
I like Knope. I screw with her because she gets all riled up, and her face scrunches up like this 
--

He demonstrates. Dave chuckles.

GREG (CONT'D)
But I like her. She’s all right.

DAVE
So you swear you didn’t do this?

GREG
I swear. I’ve been hanging out with my friends all night. And silly string isn’t really my style.

Dave thinks.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Ann is replenishing a bowl of CHIPS.

RON
Are these the same kind of chips?

ANN

Would you like them better if they had bacon wrapped around them?

RON
Yes.

ANN

Oh God.

WHIP OVER to reveal Tom and WENDY. He’s dressed like T-PAIN, with a crazy top hat and gold teeth. 
She’s a COWGIRL.

Hi. Thanks for inviting us.

TOM
She’s a surgeon at County General, and she’s super hot. Sorry we’re late.
As soon as she put on that cowgirl outfit I lost control of myself, and we got a little de-layed. 
Get it?

Wendy playfully smacks him.

ANN
Thanks for being a doctor and not coming dressed like a doctor.

WENDY
...Who’d be boring enough to do that?

Ann motions. Wendy looks over to see several DOCTORS and NURSES right near her.

WENDY (CONT’D)
Oh.

Yeah. It’s a little quiet.

TOM
No worries. The Haverfords are on the case. Sweetheart, get the iPod from the car, please.

Tom and Wendy high-five and Wendy heads off.

TOM (CONT’D)
Check this out. AutoTune.

He holds up his iPhone and we hear his AutoTuned voice.

TOM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(singing into iPhone) I’m in love with a stripper!

Ann smiles weakly.

TOM (CONT’D)
I love that. Hey -- do you have any Skyy Vodka? I only drink Skyy.

Dave, Andy, Leslie.

DAVE
I don’t know what to tell you. I really don’t think he did it.

LESLIE
Yes, he did. We need a confession. Andy and I will “take a walk.” You’ll be all alone with him. Get 
my drift?

DAVE
Leslie, you’re out of control.

LESLIE
Maybe you’re too in control?!

Andy jumps in.

ANDY
Let me take a run at him, boss. I’ll get him to talk. In order to think like one of these guys, you 
have to think like them.

Good idea. He’s never seen you before. Imply that you’re someone very important and can make his

Andy is seated across from Greg.

ANDY
(shaking hands)
Greg? Bert Macklin, FBI. I can make your life hell.

GREG
(smirks)
Just flew in from Washington, did you?

ANDY
The FBI Office in Indiana, dumbass. There’s one in Indiana.

GREG
Where?

ANDY
Bloomington. Look it up.

GREG
Okay.

Greg takes out an iPhone. Andy snatches it away.

ANDY
Gimme that.
(breaking)
Ooh, is this the new one?

GREG
Yeah. It’s awesome.

ANDY
(serious; in character)
Do yourself a favor. Get that app where it looks like you’re drinking a beer. It’s hilarious. Now 
tell me: why did you attack this office?

GREG
I’ll tell you just like I told everyone else. I didn’t do this.

Andy stares at him. Greg stares back, completely relaxed.

ANDY
You’re lying. I can tell, because of the training we went through.

GREG
I’m not lying.

Andy stares at him.

ANDY
That time it didn’t seem like you were lying.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

At the stereo, Tom leans down and removes Ann’s iPod from the dock. “Monster Mash” stops. He puts 
his own iPod on.

ANN
What are you doing?

TOM
Annie. Do you want this party to be lame or fun?

ANN
Fun.

TOM
Then relax. And turn off all the lights in here except the ones with colored bulbs.

Ann thinks. Then she flicks off some lights as Tom hits play and “RUN THIS TOWN” by Jay-Z and 
Rhianna starts playing. Tom yells out to the room.

TOM (CONT’D)
Playtime’s over, kids. Let’s get wiiiiiiiild!!

Tom grabs Wendy and they start to dance in the living room. Ann glances around and sees that people 
are starting to groove a little. She glances to camera -- “This might work?”

That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard!

ANDY


LESLIE
What’s going on?

ANDY
He’s being a little jerk.

GREG
Are you crying?!

ANDY
No. I’m allergic to jerks.

LESLIE
Andy, out. I’ll take it from here.

Fine, I don’t even care... about the... whatever... stupid...

Andy leaves. Leslie stares at Greg.

One of America’s tactics in Gitmo was to play rock music really loudly.

What is this? I kinda like it.

LESLIE
Damnit.
(to herself)
Why do you have to be so good, Sarah?

Leslie stops the music. SMACKS the peach pit down.

GREG
What’s that?

LESLIE
You know what it is. You were eating a peach when I saw you today at the school. Then my office 
gets vandalized, and I find this on my desk? You think that’s a coincidence?

GREG
Wow, you nailed me. There’s no way two different people could have both eaten fruit on the same 
day, in the same part of Indiana. Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me.

Leslie hesitates. She looks unsure. Then:

LESLIE
(angry)
I know you did this. I don’t care what you say. I don’t care that you spent the whole night in that 
parking lot. You did this, somehow, and I’m--

GREG
How did you know that?

LESLIE
...Hmm?

GREG
That I spent the whole night in that parking lot? Did you follow me?

LESLIE
I have every right to... follow people.

GREG
If you followed me all night then you know it wasn’t me! Oh my God! Knope, what is your problem?

Greg gets out his phone and dials.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Fine. You get one phone call. That’s fair.

GREG

Mom? This crazy lady from the Parks Department is holding me hostage.

Leslie looks worried.

Dave, Leslie, Andy.

LESLIE
She’s going to be here any second! Please, Dave. Arrest him.

DAVE
On what charge?

LESLIE
Then... handcuff him to something! Why do I have to come up with all the ideas?!

Dave looks over -- camera WHIPS to see DEBORAH, Greg’s mom, striding angrily into the room.

DEBORAH
Greggy? Greg!

GREG (O.S.)

Leslie, Dave, and Andy walk out of Leslie’s office and intercept Deborah. Greg comes out of the

DEBORAH
What the hell are you doing?! You can’t just hold a sixteen-year-old kid against his will.

DAVE
We just wanted to question him about this vandalism.

DEBORAH
Do you have any evidence?

LESLIE
Yes. This peach pit. Which has his DNA all over it, I’m guessing.

DEBORAH
(to Dave)
I’m calling your shift commander. (to Leslie)
Monday morning, I’m calling your boss. And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to 
God I will sue you, and everyone in this building.

They leave. Leslie looks sad. She stares after Greg.

LESLIE
Let them leave. Let them think they’ve lost us. Then we--

Dave is walking away.

LESLIE (CONT'D)
Where are you going?

DAVE
I have to explain to my boss why I illegally detained a teenager. I never should have gone along 
with this. This was... bad police work.

Dave walks off. Leslie looks defeated.

Yeah, this was bad FBI work, too.

The party is HOPPING. People are DANCING and having a good time. Tom and Wendy are dancing in the 
middle of the living room as people cheer them on.

ANN
Coming through! Coming through!

Ann walks around replenishing drinks. She sees Mark chatting with Paula again. It seems to be going 
well. She smiles and sees April, Derek, and Ben talking.

ANN (CONT’D)
How you guys doing?

BEN
We totally worked it out.

APRIL
Derek is going to be gay-monogamous with Ben, but we’re going to keep making out when we’re drunk, 
and also we agreed that we can see other people, but if I make out with any other gay guys I have 
to tell him.

DEREK
We’re not going to put a label on it.

ANN
Good thinking.

Ron comes up and looks at Ben’s pirate costume.

RON
Son. That is a helluva costume.

Thanks.

Ron shakes his head in admiration.

ANDY
Kids are kids. Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.

LESLIE
I didn’t.

ANDY
Well, you were a nerd, probably, right?



Hey.
LESLIE


ANDY
No -- I mean, that’s a good thing. You were a nerd, and I was cool, but now look at us. If you 
didn’t pay me thirty-two dollars to guard a walrus all night, I’d literally have zero dollars. 
Plus, you’re cool now.

She smiles.

LESLIE
Well. You can head on home. I’ll finish cleaning this place up.

ANDY
No way. I go home when you go home.

She looks at him.

You got me a job, you’re helping me turn my life around. You’re my guardian angel, Leslie. I’m not

Hello, Wendy. You and Tom really turned the party around.

WENDY
We have a good time together. (beat)
Listen -- I know that you know about our marriage.

Ron feigns confusion.

WENDY (CONT’D)
The whole green card thing. Tom told me you know, and that you’re not going to tell anyone. I just 
wanted to say thanks for that.

RON
No worries. I’d hate for you to have to go back to Canada. All that socialized medicine.

Ron shudders at the thought. Tom grooves over.

TOM
Sweetheart! Where have you been?

WENDY
Hey. I was just... thanking Ron. For not telling anyone...

TOM
Oh. Yeah. It’s mighty white of you, Boss.

WENDY
You won’t have to keep it secret much longer. In a few months we can split up without raising any 
eyebrows. And we’ll invite you to the divorce party!

Looking forward to it.

Tom frowns a little, then recovers.

My wife is awesome. She’s the coolest chick I’ve ever met. After we get divorced, I think I’m gonna

Leslie and Andy sit drinking beers. All of the toilet paper and silly string is in trash bags.

LESLIE
I guess this means there’s some other kid out there who’s tormenting me.

ANDY
Maybe.

LESLIE
Greg does seem innocent.

ANDY
Yeah.

LESLIE
I believe you’re innocent until proven guilty, in this country. That’s the cornerstone of 
democracy.

ANDY
Sure.

LESLIE
On the other hand. Greg Pikitis is a little punk. And I kind of want to TP his house.

ANDY
Let’s do it.

They jump up, grab the trash bags full of toilet paper, and rush out.

Just take this toilet paper and throw it into the tree.

They both start doing it.

This is for Mayor Percy! And the Parks Department office! And that time I caught you pooping on the

That’s them, officer! Right there!

Leslie panics.

LESLIE
Oh my God. I am so sorry, ma’am. I think we’re at the wrong house.

EVELYN
Why are you doing this?!
