COLD OPEN
INT. PLANNING DEPARTMENT OPEN AREA - MORNING - DAY 1 LESLIE, APRIL, TOM, JERRY, DONNA, and some 
OTHERS are all
gathered around a television, watching the news.

ANGLE ON: The TV. City Councilman CRAIG WHITLEY stands beside his wife as he reads a statement.

WHITLEY
...And to my wife, I apologize. All I can say is: I wasn’t just having sex. I was making love... to 
a beautiful woman... and her boyfriend, and a third woman, whose name I never learned. In my 
defense, it was my birthday, and I really wanted to do it.

ANGLE ON: The group.

LESLIE
(shaking her head)
City Councilman Craig Whitley. Another politico, felled by scandal.

WHITLEY (ON TV)
Furthermore, I would like to apologize to Habitat for Humanity. It was wrong of me to say I was 
building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four-way sex in a cave in 
Brazil.

TOM
I bet cave sex is in-sane.

LESLIE
Why?

TOM
...Because of the echoes... and the humidity.




Mmm.
DONNA
(smiling and nodding)


LESLIE
Ugh. Think about his wife.

TOM
Oh I will. She’s hot. I would totally have sex with her in a Brazilian cave.

CONTINUED:

JERRY
Did you hear the craziest part? I heard Jimmy Carter was having sex with them in the cave.

LESLIE
No, Jerry. Jimmy Carter just founded Habitat for Humanity -- he has nothing to do with this at all.

JERRY
(shrugs)
Well that’s what I heard.

LESLIE
It’s not true!

JERRY
Agree to disagree.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

LESLIE
People love to fixate on the tawdry details of these scandals. Personally, I care about Councilman 
Whitley’s policies, not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex... which, by 
the way, I heard he was.
(beat)
I also heard that he used city funds to pay a hooker to spank his face. But I don’t want to start 
rumors.
(beat)
He likes feet.

She holds up her hands like “That’s all I’m saying.”

ACT ONE

INT. PLANNING DEPARTMENT OPEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER - D1

April, Tom, Jerry, Donna, MARK and RON are still hung up on the scandal. They watch the TV.

NEWSCASTER (ON SCREEN)
...It turns out that Councilman Whitley may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on 
the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair. Perd Hapley, 
Channel Four Eyewitness News.

Back to scene.

MARK
Why does anyone run for office? You’re just asking to have your entire life exposed.

TOM
Well, if you’re clean, like me, there’s no problem. I’m as clean as a whistle, that’s carved out of 
soap. After it’s been washed... with soap!

MARK
You’re married, and you hit on women constantly.

TOM
Yeah, but I’ve never sealed the deal. Just window shopping. “You can fly to Brazil -- just don’t 
enter the cave.” Am I right, guys?

April high fives Tom.

INT. PIONEER HALLWAY - LATER - D1

Leslie and DAVE walk along, joking around.

DAVE
Sometimes, I wish there wasn’t any crime, but then I guess I’d be out of a job.

LESLIE
I am totally the same. I often wish the whole world was a park, but then where would you put a 
park?

DAVE
Well most of the world is water, and we still build swimming pools, so I think you’d be okay.
(then)
I should get back to my post now, but I’ll see you tomorrow night, right?

LESLIE
Absolutely.

DAVE
There’s a couple of restaurants near my house that I really want to try.

LESLIE
Great. You choose the place, for our first official date. Check. Roger that.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

In her office.

LESLIE
I’m not nervous. Why would I be nervous? We’re just two people going on a first date. There’s 
nothing to be nervous about.

Her PHONE VIBRATES. She jumps and throws the phone against the wall, where it smashes. She rubs her 
forehead.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1

Mark, Tom, Ron, Donna, Jerry, and April.

MARK
I’m sure we could find something on you, Tom.

TOM
(ticking them off)
I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school a girl beat me in a wrestling match. 
That’s it. And I bet you anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.

MARK
I’ll play. What the hell.

DONNA
I’m in.

I’m out.
JERRY


TOM
Not an option, Jerry. You’re going down.

JERRY
No seriously, I really don’t want to play.

TOM
No seriously, you are playing. We are going to nail you.

JERRY
(quietly)
Why are you doing this to me?

RON
I will play too, but only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me.

APRIL
...That’s why we’re all playing.

Ron gives April a look and goes into his office. APRIL TALKING HEAD
APRIL
I love games that turn people against each other.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D1

Leslie walks Dave out of the office.

DONNA
You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry’s Facebook.

APRIL
A friend? Burn.

JERRY
Again, I’d really rather not play.

LESLIE
What are you guys doing?

APRIL
Seeing who has the least amount of dirt on them in case we want to run for office.

DAVE
Well, it’s not Jerry. That’s for sure.

Jerry throws his hands up.

DAVE (CONT’D)
He’s got a couple of 3-5-9s. Public urination.

JERRY
It was Mardi Gras. Things got a tad out of control.

TOM
There’s no Mardi Gras in Indiana.

JERRY
You don’t have to be in the North Pole to celebrate Christmas.
(then)
I don’t like this game and I don’t wanna play anymore.

Jerry storms out.

DAVE
He’s probably going to go anger-pee in the courtyard.
(then)
Okay, you crazy bunch of park people. I’m outta here. Leslie, I will see you tomorrow night.

LESLIE
Stew and brew!

DAVE
Stew and brew!

LESLIE
Stew and brew!

Dave exits. Leslie looks worried.

APRIL
You guys are weird.

INT. PIONEER HALLWAY - LATER - D1

Mark walks down the hall and runs into ANN.

MARK
Hey -- what are you doing here?

Having lunch with Leslie. What are you doing?

Mark realizes there’s no good way to explain this.

MARK
...Well, I am looking for scandalous information about my co-workers. For a game. That we’re 
playing.


Beat.


ANN
My taxes pay your salary, right?

MARK

Yup.


Cool.


ANN

EXT. COURTYARD - LATER - D1

Leslie and Ann eat lunch. Leslie is distracted.

ANN
...So after all that, I got to tell those kids that their daddy was going to be okay.

LESLIE
(not listening)
Yeah. Hey -- I’m kind of nervous about this date tonight. Can I borrow a good “first date” outfit? 
Like maybe some cargo pants?

ANN
I don’t know if I’d go with cargo pants.

LESLIE
What about a sexy hat?

ANN
I’m not sure what that even is.

LESLIE
Helping already!

ANN
You wanna come over tonight after work?

Leslie stares at Ann intensely.

ANN
Or... you could come over now?

LESLIE
(immediately)
Sure okay that sounds good that will give us more time. Let’s go!

She runs off. Ann glances to camera and walks after her.

LESLIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Hurry!


Coming!


ANN

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1

Jerry, Donna, and April sit at their computers, eyeing each other warily as they type. Tom walks 
through, full of confidence.

TOM
Whatcha looking for, guys? Dirt on me? No point. Give up now.
(super cocky)
There’s nothing on me, except for the fact that I’m actually a robot.

Tom starts dancing like a robot. TOM TALKING HEAD
He’s still doing robot moves.

TOM
(robot)
I am an automated sex machine.

In the b.g., Ron appears in the window behind him and slaps a picture of Tom in BLACK ROBES on the 
window.

RON
Muslim robes!

Tom looks at it, and jumps up...

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D1

Tom crosses towards Ron’s office.

DONNA
(holds up Muslim robe picture) Hey Tom, nice Muslim robes.

TOM
That was Halloween -- I was dressed as a ninja.

MARK
I’m sure the voters would be able to tell the difference.

TOM
You’re all racists.

Donna stares at him.

RON
This is going to be easier than I thought, and I initially thought it was going to be incredibly 
easy.

TOM
Well, did everyone know that Ron’s ex- wife Tammy is actually his second ex-wife named Tammy? 
That’s right -- he’s got two ex-wives, each named Tammy.

RON
(to camera)
Both of them bitches. (to Tom)
Tom, that was a Jaeger-secret. You just breached a Jaeger-secret.

DONNA
Damn, this heated up quick!

RON TALKING HEAD

RON
Yes, my mom’s name is Tammy. What’s your point?

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MID-AFTERNOON - D1

Leslie models one of Ann’s dresses for Ann. PAN OVER to piles of clothes strewn everywhere.

I think that looks great!

LESLIE
Wow -- the first one I tried! How lucky.

ANN
I kind of wish you hadn’t emptied out my entire closet before we started.

LESLIE
Better safe than sorry.

ANN
Will you be wearing it out of the store, madame?

LESLIE
I think I will, good lady. Leslie starts to go and stops short.
LESLIE (CONT’D)
While I have you, can I ask you a question?



Shoot.
ANN


LESLIE
What if I choke on the date?

ANN
Like under pressure?

LESLIE
No, like on something. Celery, a raisin, whatever.

ANN
Just eat like you normally would, and you should be fine. Trust your mandible.

LESLIE
(writing that down) Mandible. Got it. Thanks.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
And also, what if he asks me if I’ve been married?

ANN
Have you?

No.
LESLIE


ANN
So, say that.

LESLIE
But, won’t he wonder why not? I think I should say I’ve been married. The real question is if I say 
I have kids. Guys like girls with kids, right?

ANN
Whoa.

LESLIE
(spiraling)
What if I get drunk and bring up Darfur too much.
(then)
Or not enough! What if I don’t bring it up enough?

ANN
Leslie, relax.

LESLIE
Okay, but real fast...

Leslie takes out a list of questions and begins to quick-fire read them to Ann.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
What if he shows up with another woman, or what if he wants to have sex through a plastic sheet? Or 
what if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly? Or what if instead of Tic Tacs I 
accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and have to keep punching my own leg to stay awake?

ANN
These are all insane hypotheticals. I promise you they won’t happen.

Leslie speaks quietly and intensely.

LESLIE
They have happened. All of those have happened to me.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

LESLIE
No -- there’s more. One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar -- I thought it was 
terrible wine.
(jump cut)
Once I went out with a guy who wore 3-D glasses the entire night, even while we made out.
(jump cut)
Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and when I fell asleep he tried to pull 
out one of my teeth. I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth. We went out a few more times, 
but then he got weird.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - D1

Leslie and Ann sit on the couch.

LESLIE
Look, I know it sounds crazy -- I’m a grown woman. It’s just the first date. I’ve had an incredibly 
bad run of first dates over the last fifteen years, and every time it happens, I feel terrible 
about myself...

ANN
Okay. You have a problem. And we’re going to fix it.

LESLIE
I know what you’re going to suggest, but they take a long time and we need two more people.

ANN
...What? What did you think I was going to suggest?

LESLIE
A bridge tournament, to take my mind off of things? No?

ANN
No. What? No. We’ll go on a practice date. I’ll pretend to be Dave, and you can practice on me.

Tom is reading something. WENDY enters.

WENDY
Hey, Tommy. You ready?

TOM
Yes I am, darlin’ -- just give me one second.

Tom looks over at Donna.

TOM (CONT’D)
Hey Donna, let me ask you something -- do you hate black people?

DONNA
Excuse me?

TOM
Apparently, in 1988, you gave money to the Presidential campaign of David Duke.

JERRY
The Klansman?

DONNA
(fuming)
I got a phone call... they said he would lower taxes...

TOM
Boom! How’s it feel to lose so hard? (to Wendy)
Sorry. Let’s get coffee.

Tom and Wendy head to the courtyard, passing Ron.

TOM (CONT’D)
Honey, you remember my boss, Ron Swanson.

WENDY
Of course. How are you?

RON
Fine, thank you. How are things at the hospital?

WENDY
Really well, thanks -- I just got a Pediatric Surgery fellowship.

Leslie and Ann sit at a bar having a glass of wine.

ANN
So, from now on, I’m Dave. I’ll be sitting here waiting for you and you come to the table.

LESLIE
Should I go all the way back home?

ANN
...No.

LESLIE
Back to the car?

ANN
No. Just walk up.

LESLIE
Okay. This is fun.

Leslie walks three steps away and then turns around. She waves at Ann like she’s seeing her for the 
first time.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(waving)
Hey Dave, it’s me. It’s Leslie.

Leslie walks up.

ANN
Hi, Leslie. Great to see you.

LESLIE
So.

Let’s begin our conversation.

ANN
...You don’t have to... I mean, you should just start talking.

ANN
Leslie is in worse shape than I thought. (beat)
I probably shouldn’t have left her at the bar alone.

She turns around to see Leslie in the b.g., practicing eating from an empty plate and pantomiming 
conversation as the other diners stare at her.

INT. RESTAURANT - BAR - LATER - D1

Leslie is rambling nervously.

LESLIE
...Of course, in German it’s auf und ab Maschine, which quite literally means the “up and down 
machine.”

ANN
Wow. That is a thorough history of the “teeter-totter.”

LESLIE
What should our second topic be?

ANN
Just... ask me a question. Try to get to know me.

LESLIE
Okay.

Beat. Leslie stares at her. Ann stares back: “Well?” Leslie opens her mouth. Nothing comes out.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
I can’t think of anything to ask you. Not one thing. My mind is blank.

Wow.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1

Tom, April, Jerry, and Donna are still trying to uncover each other’s dirty laundry. Mark walks in.

JERRY
(nervously)
Hey Mark, a little birdie told me you have one unpaid parking ticket.

MARK
Really Jerry, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana 
possession.

JERRY
(broken) What?

MARK
Oh you didn’t know, huh?

JERRY
I didn’t know I was adopted.

Beat. Mark looks like he feels bad.

MARK
Oh no. Sorry.

RON
(big smile) Tommy Tomatoes.

TOM
Ronald McRonald!

RON
Congratulate me.

TOM
On what?

RON
Winning the game. I just found out, through some back channels, that your wedding was a sham. It’s 
a green card marriage.

TOM
That’s crazy! I was born in South Carolina. These colors don’t run.

RON
Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa. Canada. Her visa was set to expire the day after you got 
married... at the county courthouse, in front of three strangers and no family.

Beat. Tom is screwed.

TOM
(sighs)
We met in college.. she wanted to work in the states, she couldn’t get a permit...

Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.

TOM
Dude. Ronseph. Games aside, you gotta be cool about this.

RON
Don’t worry, I’m not going to turn you in. I don’t want her to get deported back to Canada. Just 
admit, when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game. Say I bested you

TOM
Fine. You bested me. Is that all?

RON
No. I’ll have your wife tonight.

What?

I’m just kidding. Get out of here.

Tom leaves, forcing a smile.

ANN TALKING HEAD

Ann is all business.

ANN
Leslie has a medical-grade phobia. In nursing school, we did a psych unit on how to treat phobias 
with a method called “exposure therapy.” It’s like, if you’re scared of snakes, we would immerse 
you in a tank of snakes. I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date.

INT. RESTAURANT - BAR - CONTINUOUS - D1

Leslie gets up and sits back down.

LESLIE
Hi, Dave--

ANN
You’re late. And I can see your nipples through that shirt.

Leslie looks panicked.

LESLIE
What?

ANN
You’re twenty minutes late -- I almost left.

LESLIE
I thought I was on time? (covering)
I’m sorry... I had to drop my niece off at... swimming.

ANN
What’s your niece’s name?

LESLIE
(immediately)
Jorping! No. Jorping’s not even a name. And I don’t have a niece. My niece’s name is “Stephanie!”

ANN
Please don’t lie to me.

Ann and Leslie have moved to a table.

ANN
I don’t care about the history of the teeter-totter. That doesn’t interest me.

LESLIE
Oh God. That was going to be my opener. Okay. Just hang on. I’ll think of something. Oh look -- 
bread!

Leslie offers some bread to Ann, knocking over a vase of flowers, which drop into Ann’s stew.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(panicking) Flowers!

Leslie picks the flowers out of Ann’s stew.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
I got flowers in your stew.

Leslie quickly puts the flowers into Ann’s water glass.

ANN
That’s my water.

LESLIE
It’s delicious. Leslie drinks Ann’s water.
LESLIE (CONT’D)
I have to go to the... whizz palace. (off Ann’s look)
Oh God. I forgot the name of the toilet place. What is it, Dave? What’s the name of the toilet 
place?!?!?!

So we’re on the same page.

Mark looks puzzled.

TOM (CONT’D)
You gotta help me take this guy down. There has to be something on him.

MARK
I’m starting to feel kind of gross about this game. I don’t think people’s pasts should be dredged 
up and put on display.

TOM
(genuine)
It’s not about the game anymore. Ron has some serious dirt on me, and I need to balance things out. 
Please.

Mark stares at Tom.

MARK
There’s a guy named Duke Silver. He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton. He’s an old friend of Ron’s -- 
maybe you should ask him.

TOM
Thanks, man. I’m going to dig up so much dirt on that guy that I will need a shovel.

That sounded way snappier in my head.

Tom heads off.

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER - N1

Ann and Leslie sit at the table. Each has a bowl of STEW.

LESLIE
(defensive)
Why would you say that, Dave? I loved that dog. She was my best friend. Her funeral was the saddest 
day of...

ANN
(loud) Brrrring. Brrrrring.
(mimes holding phone)
Hey, Tiffany. Sure, I can see you tonight. Yeah, definitely wear that.

Not right now, I’m on a date with a real drip. Oh, okay, I’ll ask.
(to Leslie)
Hey, are you into three-ways?

LESLIE
You know what, Dave? You’re disgusting.

ANN
That’s a “no” on the three-way?

LESLIE
Okay. Well, this has been a disaster. I don’t need to be here anymore. Thanks, Dave, for nothing. 
Don’t call me.
Goodbye.

She grabs her purse. Ann smiles.

ANN
All right! Well done.

LESLIE
...Are you still talking to the person on the phone?

ANN
You survived. You passed.

Leslie looks confused.

ANN (CONT’D)
Sorry. I had to get “medical” on you. Now you see, though, that even if everything goes wrong, 
you’ll survive. Just a bad date.

LESLIE
(sitting back down)
Well well well. You coy bastard.

ANN
You just had to find your spine. And you did.

LESLIE
I knew it all along. (beat)
I didn’t know it all along. I was super confused. I almost cried a little, in the whizz palace.

A WAITER passes by.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

B-roll: Leslie and Ann drinking, having a good time, laughing, dancing, drinking...

LESLIE (V.O.)
Ann is so awesome. I’m lucky to have a friend who would spend her night off pretending to treat me 
so poorly.

INT. RESTAURANT - BAR - LATER - N1

Leslie and Ann sit at the bar again, both a little tipsy.

ANN
I want you to hear me on this. Most first dates are train wrecks. Andy took me to the state fair. I 
paid for everything because he “forgot his money in his other wallet.” Then, he rode the 
“Gravitron” without me four times and threw up a candied turkey leg all over me. And then we dated 
for three years.

LESLIE
What if it isn’t a disaster, but he just... doesn’t like me that much?

ANN
Impossible. It’s impossible not to like you. He’s going to freak out because of how awesome you 
are!

LESLIE
(sincerely) Thank you, Dave.

ANN
I’m Ann now.

Ann finishes her drink. Leslie does the same.

ANN (CONT’D)
Listen to me: he’s going to love you. You’re cool and sexy and funny and smart, and any guy would 
be lucky to go on a date with you!

LESLIE
Yeah!

Leslie bangs on the door to a house. She’s all riled up with liquid courage. DAVE answers.

DAVE
...Hey.

LESLIE
(super cocky) Yeah -- I’m here.

DAVE
I see that.

LESLIE
I know that right now, it’s today, and not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that you’re 
lucky to have me, and that our first date tomorrow is gonna be off-the-charts amazing. Up top!

Dave gives Leslie a tentative high five.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Let’s do this, bitch! I’m not scared. I’ll go on the date right now.

DAVE
I don’t think that’s the best idea.

LESLIE
You know what? Lemme in. Move. You make a better door than a... guy.

Leslie pushes past him into his house.

ACT THREE

INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER - N1

Tom is at a jazz club, looking around. He goes up to the BARTENDER.

TOM
Hey -- this is going to sound weird. I’m looking for a guy named Duke Silver?

BARTENDER
Yeah -- he goes on in a second.

The bartender gestures toward the stage. Tom is confused, but sits down. Looks around -- almost the 
ENTIRE AUDIENCE is WOMEN between the ages of 40-60.

INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Leslie is sprawled out on the couch. Dave fixes some food in the kitchen and brings it to her.

DAVE
Wow. You sure know a lot about teeter totters.

LESLIE
No -- you know a lot about teeter totters!

DAVE
I do now. Here, I heated up some leftover pizza and brought you water and coffee and several 
aspirin.

LESLIE
Are you hot? I’m like, burning up.

DAVE
Hmmm, it may be a little on the warm side, sure.

LESLIE
I’m awesome.

DAVE
Okay.

LESLIE
It’s honestly hot in here.

DAVE
Lemme see what I can do about that.

DAVE TALKING HEAD

DAVE
It’s freezing cold in here.

He counts to four in his head and then walks back. INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER - N1
Tom sits and waits. An EMCEE takes the stage.

EMCEE
Ladies, ladies, ladies... it’s about that time. It is with the jazziest pleasure that I bring 
you... Mr. Duke Silver!

The women go nuts as Ron takes the stage. In a sexy, sharkskin suit, wearing sunglasses and a 
fedora. With a saxophone.

RON
Good evening. As always, it’s a thrill to be here, during this witching hour, with you fine ladies. 
Now relax, as the Duke Silver Trio takes you on a journey... to yourself.

Ron wields a saxophone and begins playing “Almost Paradise” from “Footloose.” Tom looks at the 
camera, elated, and begins taking pictures with his phone.

EXT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

She comes to the door. Mark is there.

ANN






Beat.
Hey. Hello.


MARK




ANN
Can I help you? At 11:48 P.M.?

MARK
I was on my way home, and I had to pass your house. So I dropped by, instead of calling. And that 
pretty much brings us up to date.

ANN
Great.

Okay, here’s the whole thing. Here’s all my skeletons.
(deep breath)
When I was sixteen I had sex with a married woman. When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount 
of pot, nothing insane... and I cheated on a test, but in my defense--

ANN
What the hell are you doing?

MARK
I’ve done some stuff in my life that I’m not proud of. And I like you, so I’d rather you not find 
out about it from anyone but me.
(beat)
This was a bad idea.

ANN
No. I get what this is, and why you did it.

She smiles.

MARK
Anything you want to tell me about your past? To balance the scales?

ANN
Yeah. One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight to brag about getting laid when he was 
sixteen, so I murdered him.

MARK
Good night.

He heads off.

INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Dave sits back down as Leslie tries to remove her sweater. It’s a shirt-sweater combo.

LESLIE
I need to return this sweater. I think it fused to my shirt in the dryer or something.

DAVE
I think it may be one of those sweater- shirt combos.

Did you see my bra? I was gonna wear the good one tomorrow. Can I use the bathroom?
(bragging)
Impressed I know what that’s called?

DAVE
Yeah. Maybe I should just give you a lift home.

Leslie suddenly realizes exactly what she’s done.

LESLIE
Oh God. Oh my God, I went to your house. I drank too much and went to your house, is what I did.

DAVE
Leslie--

LESLIE
No, don’t say anything. Please. Don’t say a word. Just take me home.

He gets up and they head to the door. INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER - N1
Ron finishes up playing on stage. The band continues with rhythm behind him.

RON
You are all beautiful creatures of the earth, and it’s been a real gift making sonic love to you 
tonight.

Tom is still delighted.

RON (CONT’D)
If you want more of the Duke, I have both of my CDs for sale: “Smooth As Silver” and “Hi Ho, Duke.”

He holds them up.

RON (CONT’D)
And look for my new album next month, “Memories...of Now.” So, come see me, come talk to me, come 
love with me... or we can just howl at the moon together.
Thank you. Good night.

He plays ONE LONG LAST NOTE and runs off the stage to uproarious applause. The lights come up.

Ron towels off, then wades into the crowd to sign autographs. He flirts and takes pictures with a 
few women. Tom steps up.

TOM
Duuuuke. Huge fan.

Ron looks up and he and Tom share a tense moment. Ron starts slowly clapping.

RON TALKING HEAD

RON
Yes. Once a month, at a bar in Eagleton, Indiana, I play tenor jazz saxophone under the name Duke 
Silver, for an audience of mature women.

He stares at the camera. INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER - N1
Ron and Tom speak quietly in a corner.

RON
Look, Tom. I imagine you’ll want to tell everyone about this, but I’ve worked pretty hard to 
cultivate a certain... authoritative, or intimidating, image around the office--

A 70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN comes up to Ron with a camera.

70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
Can I get a picture?

RON
(gritted teeth) Sure.

Tom takes the camera.

TOM
Say “I bested you!”

70 YEAR-OLD WOMAN (going with it)
“I bested you!” Tom snaps the picture.

at Ron.

Establishing. Night-to-day.

INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - MORNING - DAY 2

Leslie, looking miserable, sits in her office.

TOM
You showed up at a dude’s house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn’t even sleep with 
him?!

LESLIE
No. Should I have? Would that have made it better?

TOM
It never hurts.

Dave pokes his head in and knocks on the door frame.

DAVE
Hey.

TOM
(leaning back in his chair)
Nice.

DAVE
You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night. Earrings, your purse...

a shoe somehow. Not sure how I didn’t notice the shoe.

Sure. Seems like you two have a lot to be awkward with each other about.

Tom leaves.

LESLIE
I am so sorry for last night. On my list of embarrassing things I’ve done in my life, that is 
numbers one through seven.

DAVE
Ah, forget about it. We all do stupid stuff when we’re drunk. One time I handcuffed myself to my 
gun.
(smiles)
So, I can’t wait until our second date tonight.



Second?
LESLIE


DAVE
Yeah -- our first date was last night. So tonight would be our second one. I’m looking forward to 
it. Stew and brew?
Eight o’clock?

LESLIE
(re-excited) Stew and brew!

Leslie is glowing.

LESLIE                  *
Our first date happened, and I didn’t even know about it. A.K.A. -- I nailed it. No fires, no 
ambulances -- just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy’s house late at night. Knope for 
the win!

WOMAN #1
Duke Silver is the sexiest man alive.

I can only listen to his CDs while my husband’s at work.

WOMAN #3
My kids think I’m at book club.

TOM
He is to die for.

I vacuum to “Hi Ho, Duke.” I make love to “Smooth as Silver.”

I made my husband grow a mustache like Duke’s. It’s just not the same.
