LESLIE TALKING HEAD

AS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPT:

LESLIE
It’s so fun -- it’s like I’m Tim Gunn from Project Runway.
(Tim Gunn)
“Designers. Make it work. Tim Gunn.”

MUST SHOOT:

LESLIE (CONT’D)
It’s so fun -- it’s like I’m Tim Gunn from Project Runway, but instead of creating stylish outfits 
for models, we’re making appropriate murals for bureaucrats. Just as thrilling.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
It’s so fun -- it’s like I’m Tim Gunn from Project Runway, but instead of beautiful gowns, we’ll be 
choosing murals for a municipal building’s hallways. Why don’t they do reality shows about this 
stuff?



LESLIE (CONT’D)
It’s so fun -- it’s like I’m Tim Gunn from Project Runway, but instead of beautiful gowns, we’re 
making murals for a municipal building’s hallway.
Project Hallway. (then)
Wait, no, Project Municipal Building Mural Creation.


She smiles.

SCENE 14 - LESLIE TH ABOUT THE MURALS, HER MURAL DREAMS

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

AS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPT:

LESLIE
I know everything about this town, and these murals. This is a dream come true. Literally -- I once 
had a dream where I got to design a mural. But, it turned into a nightmare, because the mural came 
to life and started whispering to me. And I got closer so I could hear it, and then it ate me.
At some point Gina Gershon was there, I think. Whatever. Dreams are weird. The point is, I love 
murals.

MUST SHOOT:

LESLIE (CONT’D)
I know everything about this town, and these murals. This is a dream come true. Literally -- I once 
had a dream where I got to design a mural. But then I became a mollusk and my mom tried to open me.
(beat)
Point is: I love murals.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
I know everything about this town, and these murals. This is a dream come true. Literally -- I once 
had a dream where I got to design a mural... for Idi Amin. I turned him down even though I really 
needed the money, because in the dream I was being evicted from my space ship. Oh, April was there, 
too.
(beat)
Point is: I love murals.



LESLIE (CONT’D)
I know everything about this town, and these murals. This is a dream come true. Literally -- I once 
had a dream where I got to design a mural.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
I know everything about this town, and these murals. This is a dream come true. Literally -- I once 
had a dream where I got to design a mural. The weird thing was that my feet were where my hands 
should be and my mouth was a pencil sharpener.



LESLIE (CONT’D)
There hasn’t been a new mural put on these walls in seventy years. I do not want to see sewage or 
garbage trucks or on these walls.



LESLIE (CONT’D)
Those beautiful murals have spent seventy years on the wall, being covered up, ignored, protested 
against and defaced with every material imaginable. I just want our department to be given that 
same opportunity.

B-roll: April is taking trash out of the dumpster. APRIL TALKING HEAD

If you’re an artist in Paris, everywhere you look, you’re inspired. When you’re in Pawnee, you’re 
inspired to buy a bus ticket and get the hell out of here.

MUST SHOOT:

APRIL TALKING HEAD

APRIL
My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.

REVEAL that she is standing in a dumpster.

APRIL
Real art should shock people. Especially in the nose.



APRIL (CONT’D)
Great art should make you gag.



APRIL (CONT’D)
I wanted to use medical waste, but they have a lock on their dumpster and Ann wouldn’t give me a 
key. What a bitch.

APRIL (CONT’D)
This dumpster is full of art. It’s behind an art school. They throw out all their old projects.



APRIL (CONT’D)
Art, love, and trash. You know you’re doing it right when it makes you want to puke.

APRIL (CONT’D)
I think that art should be inspiring and should be really something honest and true.

B-roll: April dumpster-dives.

APRIL (CONT’D)
Name one great artist who didn’t start in a dumpster.
(then)
So do a lot of whores.

AS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPT:

They all mill around, getting tired.

LESLIE
Come on guys, let’s turn this deadlock into a live-lock.

TOM
You keep saying that, but I have no idea what it means.

MUST SHOOT:

LESLIE
I got it. We put all of the art in a circle on the ground. We take a bottle, put it in the middle, 
and spin it. Whichever one it lands on is the winner.

TOM
(staring at Ann)
And if anything else happens, then it happens.

LESLIE

Okay. The results to vote number five are: one to one to one to one to one. Please...

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Okay, anyone in favor of yet another recount?

Tom, Jerry, and Ann raise their hands. Leslie, April, and Donna do not.

JERRY
April, your piece of art kind of made me tear up.

APRIL
Ah ha! See, because it’s moving.

JERRY
No, I think some of the garbage may have chemicals in it.
(explaining)
I’m allergic to certain industrial cleaners.
