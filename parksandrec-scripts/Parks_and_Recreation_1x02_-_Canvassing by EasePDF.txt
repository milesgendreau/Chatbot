ACT ONE

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - MORNING - DAY 1

LESLIE strides down the hallway, into the Parks Department.

LESLIE
Hello, Donna. I have the conference room booked for this morning, right?

DONNA
Yup.

LESLIE
And the large meeting room for tomorrow night?

DONNA
Yes. Stop asking.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

In her office.

LESLIE
Tomorrow night is our very first public forum solely about our new park project. It’s like my 
sub-committee’s Debutante Ball. Or Bar Mitzvah. Or -- what’s the name of that Native American thing 
where they send the kids off into the desert to have visions or something?

CAMERA PANS OVER to TOM.

TOM
Wet Dream.

LESLIE
Really? Okay. Like the proud Wamapoke tribes of yore, this will be the Sub- committee’s first Wet 
Dream.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER - D1

Leslie, MARK, ANN, APRIL, and Tom have gathered. Mark has a bowl of OATMEAL in front of him. Leslie 
is shuffling papers.

ANN
(to Mark)
Mm. Hearty breakfast.

MARK
It’s the most important meal of the day.

ANN
I think lunch is the most important-- Leslie very, very loudly, bangs her GAVEL.
ANN / MARK / TOM
Wow. That was loud. / You don’t need to do that. / Whoa!

LESLIE
Sub-committee members! This is a very, very exciting and important day.
Tomorrow is our first public forum about the park project.

MARK
Yeah... I want to say again, this is a bad idea. It’s way too early for a public forum.

LESLIE
Normally. Which is why we’re going to stack the deck in our favor... Today, we’re going canvassing!

No responses.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Canvassing!

TOM
We heard.

LESLIE
Going door-to-door, talking to Ann’s neighbors, whipping them into an excited, positive frenzy, and 
getting them to come to the forum. Canvassing!

ANN
That sounds great!

MARK
Okay. I don’t want to be the guy who just keeps saying that things are bad ideas.
(beat)
But what the hell. That’s also a bad idea. We don’t have anything concrete to say to them.

LESLIE
Again, I’m one step ahead of you here. Because I’ve written a script for us.

Ann smiles. Mark sighs and shrugs. “I tried.”

Leslie hands out enormous, unwieldy BINDERS. The team flips through them.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
It covers every eventuality and tells you exactly what to say.

TOM
(reading)
“If person is a man, turn to page two.” (he turns)
“Hello, Man.”

ANN
What are the arrows and stop signs for?

LESLIE
I decided to use something I’m familiar with from childhood.

TOM
Loneliness.

LESLIE
Choose Your Own Adventure. I read all the “Choose Your Own Adventure” books.

TOM
Because you had no friends.

LESLIE
Because I love adventures.

ANN
Well, I’m excited.

LESLIE
(beaming)
And I’m excited that you’re excited! Take an hour to look over the scripts, and I’ll see you at the 
pit, where we will team up.
(to Ann, semi-whispered) You’re with me!

ANN
(smiling) Okay.

MARK TALKING HEAD

MARK
...Bad idea.

INT. MARLENE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - D1

Leslie strikes an affectedly casual pose in the doorway.

LESLIE
Hey there, Education Czar a.k.a. “My Mom!”

MARLENE
In or out, Leslie. Doorway is creepy.

Leslie smiles at the camera -- how funny is her mom? LESLIE TALKING HEAD
LESLIE
My mother is my hero. She’s been on the Pawnee School Board since 1989. She invented the motto of 
the Pawnee public schools: “Every Kid’s an Honors Student.” She came up with that when she 
eliminated the honors program.

INT. MARLENE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D1

Leslie can’t seem to find a nonchalant perch.

LESLIE
So. You hear about the Deputy Mayor?

MARLENE
Ooooh -- no. You got dirt?

LESLIE
Huge dirt. I read in the paper he’s lukewarm about the Mayor’s new clean streets initiative. You 
didn’t hear it from me.

Marlene stares at her.

MARLENE
What do you want, Leslie?

LESLIE
Nothing. I’m just dropping in to gossip, chat, talk -- like we always do. But we’re both super 
busy, so I will bid you adieu.

LESLIE (CONT'D)
(she bows dorkily, then)
Oh, speaking of -- wow, I almost forgot -- I have this thing tomorrow night. My first sub-committee 
public forum, 7pm...
Gonna get the people out, rap about our park proposal... I’ll be leading it, so... no biggie. But 
kind of a biggie, I guess. Anyway, if you want to pop by?

Marlene laughs.

MARLENE
Why in a million years would I want to do something like that?

Leslie laughs, too. Way harder than Marlene.

LESLIE
Ha ha! That is so true. Which is why I was fake-inviting you.

Marlene sighs.

MARLENE
Tomorrow night at seven?

LESLIE
Council chambers.

MARLENE
Make sure you serve good refreshments.

LESLIE
I’ll tape off a seat for you.

MARLENE TALKING HEAD

MARLENE
My daughter... means well.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1

Outside Ron’s office.

RON (O.S.)
(calling) Leslie?

RON pokes his head out. Only April is there, texting.

RON (CONT’D)
Where’s Leslie?

Are you here?

Yeah.

RON
What’s your name again?

APRIL
Natalie.

RON
...No. It’s “April,” isn’t it?

APRIL
Yeah.

RON
Why did you say Natalie?

APRIL
I don’t know.

Ron stares at her.

RON
Come here.

They walk to the PERMITS DESK. There’s already a couple PEOPLE waiting to be helped.

RON (CONT’D)
You’re on permits duty.

He walks off. April looks at the people.

APRIL
...Next.

RON TALKING HEAD

In the b.g., April stares blankly at the STACKS OF PERMITS. Moves one to another stack. Moves it 
back.

RON
April is a very sour, obstructionist person. That makes her my ideal representative of the 
government. If citizens come here looking for a handout and they’re greeted by a kind, warm person 
who helps them efficiently, they might be tempted to come back. I can’t risk that.

EXT. PIT - DAY - D1

Leslie hands out little care packages to the team.

LESLIE
Okay -- I’ve got bottled water, everyone take one. Stay hydrated. Here’s some sunscreen for your 
beaks -- Tom, you probably don’t need any -- and everyone take a packet of gorp.

She passes around PLASTIC BAGGIES filled with GORP. They’re labeled with hand-written stickers that 
say “Knope Gorp!”

TOM
Mmmmmm!

ANN
When did you have time to do all this, you nut?

LESLIE
Aw, it’s nothing. Just a little something I whipped up.

MARK
My gorp is all gummy bears.

LESLIE
Ding ding ding ding! You got the lucky gorp pack! You win a prize! The prize is gorp.
(tosses him some gorp)
Gorp is delicious, but it’s also pure energy.

supporters.

Ann shakes her head, smiling. ANN TALKING HEAD
ANN
Leslie’s incredible. She has the energy of a 10-year old.
(holds up gorp)
And the same taste in snacks.

EXT. PIT - MOMENTS LATER - D1

Leslie uses a stick to point at a map of Pawnee, placed on the ground.

LESLIE
I’ve divided the neighborhood into thirty- two sectors -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, et cetera. We’ll split up into two teams.

MARK
Team One, et cetera.

LESLIE
Exactly. Teams are me and Ann, Tom and Mark.
(she links arms with Ann) And we’re gonna win!

TOM
Win what?

LESLIE
On your marks... go get ‘em!

She BOLTS out of frame. Ann, after a beat, jogs after her. Tom and Mark look at each other.

TOM

Teammates.


Uh-huh.


MARK

EXT. GWENDOLYN’S HOUSE - LATER - D1

This is going to be great. We’re like door-to-door salesmen, but we’re selling something wonderful,

ANN
Definitely.

LESLIE
Good! Look humble.

A woman, GWENDOLYN, answers the door.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(to Ann) Woman. Page two.
(she flips a binder page)
Good morning, friend! We are representatives of your local government. Do you have a moment to talk 
about the Sullivan Street Pit?

GWENDOLYN

Sure.


Excellent!


LESLIE
(flipping through binder)
Said yes... no husband visible... ah! Here we go. Would you support turning that lot into a 
community park?

GWENDOLYN
...Sure. That sounds like a good idea.

Ann and Leslie smile at each other. This is going well.

ANN
Well, we’re having a public forum tomorrow -- would you like to come by?

LESLIE
(prompting)
“To voice your strong support.”

ANN
...to voice your strong support?

GWENDOLYN
Tomorrow...

Honey, what are we doing tomorrow night?

HUSBAND (O.S.)
Watching TV.

GWENDOLYN
Sorry, we can’t make it. We’re busy.

ANN
Oh, but it would be really great if you could come--

LESLIE
Ann, wait--

Leslie keeps flipping... it takes a while.

GWENDOLYN
Sorry. Good luck. I’m all for a park.

ANN
Okay. Well, thanks for your time.

LESLIE
Wait -- just... hang on...

Leslie keeps flipping. Finally.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Thanks for your time.

Ann looks at the camera.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - PERMITS DESK - LATER - D1

A WOMAN IN LINE talks to April.

WOMAN IN LINE
(handing back a permit)
No, I need a tree planting application. This is for docking boats.

April hands her another form.

WOMAN IN LINE (CONT’D)
This is also for boats.

APRIL
You’re a boat.

EXT. BARRY’S HOUSE - LATER - D1
Mark and Tom talk to BARRY. He’s eating a fudgesicle. In the EXTREME B.G., we see a DALLAS COWBOYS 
CHEERLEADERS
poster with LAURA LINNEY’S FACE taped over the faces.

BARRY
Hello?

TOM
Hey! Barry!

Mark glances at Tom, confused.

TOM (CONT’D)
It’s Barry -- the weirdo who comes to all our public forums.

Barry smiles pleasantly.

TOM (CONT'D)
Listen, man, we’re meeting at the council chambers tomorrow --

BARRY
I’ll be there.

TOM
I know you will. It’s about that pit on Sullivan.

BARRY
(brandishes the fudgesicle)
You shut the fuck up about that pit!!!!

MARK
(holding up hands) Whoa, man, take it easy.

BARRY
(also holding up hands)
Whoa, man, relax! Tom, call off the dogs!

MARK
Okay. Thanks for your time.

They walk off. Barry yells after them.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - STREET - LATER - D1

Leslie and Ann on the sidewalk talking to a MAN.

MAN
I don’t think so.

ANN
Really?

MAN
Yeah. I used to live near a park. Traffic, lights, kids playing... I don’t think I want that.

LESLIE
(flips through binder)
Well, let me address the traffic concern with several data points... hold please...

The man looks annoyed. Off Ann’s look... ANN TALKING HEAD
ANN
A lot of people don’t want a park, surprisingly. Some are just apathetic. Turns out it’s really 
hard to get people involved.

B-roll: Ann and Leslie at a series of peoples’ doors... after each of them, Leslie charges on. Ann 
gets slower and more disappointed.

ANN (CONT’D)
(to camera)
I guess the only reason I’m involved is that my boyfriend fell into a giant pit. Maybe Leslie and I 
should start shoving people into the pit. Anyway, at least I’m with Leslie. She’s... intense. But 
awesome.

Leslie JOGS into frame.

EXT. MORGAN’S HOUSE - LATER - D1

A guy, MORGAN, talks to Mark and Tom.

MORGAN
A park, huh? That seems like a good idea.

MARK
Great. Would you be willing to come to a public forum tomorrow and show your support?

MORGAN
Absolutely! Hey listen, will there be a playground for children at this park? Or maybe like a kids’ 
pool?

MARK
Oh. You have kids?

MORGAN

Nope. Uh oh.
TOM MORGAN
Also, will this park be at least one thousand yards from my place? ‘Cause I really don’t want to 
have to move again.

MARK
Okay. Later, man.

Morgan closes the door and they walk off.

MARK (CONT’D)
Awesome. Canvassing was a great idea.

Ann is obviously tired. Leslie isn’t.

LESLIE
Keep moving, keep going, nose to the grindstone, no means yes.

ANN
(stopping her)
Leslie. Can we maybe take a break?

LESLIE
It’s been an hour and a half. Have some gorp!

ANN
It’s just -- nobody’s saying they’ll definitely come. I wish we could just push a button and make 
the pit fill in with dirt.

Leslie is horrified.

LESLIE
Never wish that. Ann, the whole point of democracy is decisions are made by the people, as a group. 
This is a gift, to be able to talk to them. A gift from the founding fathers.

ANN
I get that. I do. But also, it’s my day off, and I’m hot.

LESLIE
...You’d rather live in a dictatorship?

ANN
I guess not.

Wait. Check it out.

porch.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Young mother. And she’s preggers. Total park bait. She’ll come to the forum.

ANN
Leslie...

LESLIE
She will. If anyone will, she will.

Leslie approaches.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Hello there! I’m Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department, and this is my colleague Ann.

KATE
Hi -- Kate Spivak.

LESLIE
Hey, Kate. We’re here because your government has a great idea. We want to put an awesome new park 
on the abandoned lot over on Sullivan Street--

KATE
Uh-oh.
(picking daughter up) Are we stinky?

LESLIE
Yes she is. We’re having a forum tomorrow night to discuss our plans--

If you really cared about your daughter, you’d come to the forum and support the park!









A beat.
KATE
...Excuse me?

LESLIE
(small)
Because parks are nice for kids.



KATE
And... just to be clear. I don’t care about my child unless I come to your thing and support your 
whatever?

When did you say this forum was?

KATE

ACT TWO

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - STREET - LATER - D1

SPY SHOT: Five or six KIDS crowd Tom’s VAN. They tighten into a circle.

TOM
Okay. Looking good out there, guys.

DUKIE
Mr. Haverford, one lady bought a chocolate but then she ate it and said it tasted bad and wanted 
her money back.

TOM
Come on! You gotta leave before they eat it. And do not call the bars “chocolate,” ‘cause legally 
they don’t contain the right ingredients. Okay -- break’s over. Go.

Tom gives them high-fives all around, and the kids run off in various directions. Tom turns, 
notices the camera. Caught.

TOM TALKING HEAD

TOM
It’s a youth basketball team I coach.

He looks nervous. JUMP CUT.

TOM (CONT’D)
Fine, it’s kids selling candy door-to- door. It’s a good deal for them. They get exercise, they’re 
outside, and I split the profits fifty-fifty, with a small twenty percent commission, which I also 
get. It’s like sports, with candy. For money.

EXT. PIT - LATER - D1

The team has reconvened, minus Tom.

LESLIE
Okay, Tom called me a second ago and said he was doing great, so I told him to keep at it. For the 
rest of us: new strategy.

MARK
We go home.

Ha ha. Goal readjustment: we concentrate on each getting just one park supporter to that forum. If 
you change one mind, you can change the world. How? Because if each of those one minds each changes 
three more minds, that’s nine minds, right? Plus the original three. Pretty soon that forum is 
packed!

They look at her, disheartened. Beat.

MARK
If I can suggest something?

LESLIE
Always.

MARK
Maybe we should shake up the teams. Re- energize a little.

LESLIE
Great! I like the way you think. How about me and Mark--


MARK
I’ll go with Ann.

I’ll go with Mark.

back.

Leslie soldiers on, talking to camera.

LESLIE
Yes, I am currently a canvassing team of one. But when a government employee is among her people, 
she can never be lonely. In times like these, I always think: W-W-M-M-D. What Would My Mom Do?
(thinks)
...She’d call my mom! (takes out phone, then)
No. She’d figure it out on her own.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - STREET - LATER - D1

Mark and Ann walk along.

ANN
So, you’ve worked with Leslie for a while. She’s a little... uptight, isn’t she?

MARK
Leslie? Nooooo. ...Yes. Yes, very.

MARK
Yeah. I used to be as optimistic as Leslie when I first started. She’s kept it going for eleven 
years. I lost it the first month.

Leslie walks down a street, still talking to camera.

LESLIE
I just have to prove to Ann that it’s about perseverance. All I need is one strong “I’ll be there.” 
The next person I meet, I’m converting.

Leslie stops. The house in front of her has an AMERICAN FLAG hanging on the porch. She smiles.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
That’s the one. I can feel it.

Leslie KNOCKS on the door. An older man, FRED TESSOP, answers.



Hello.
FRED


LESLIE
Hello, sir, I’m from the Pawnee Parks Department. We’re holding a forum tomorrow night to discuss 
turning that pit on Sullivan Street into a park.

FRED
Hmm... have you considered a new senior center? The one I go to has very slippery floors. It’s like 
a giant bathtub!

LESLIE
Well, sir, I firmly believe that a park is the way to go. I’d love to spend a little time with you 
and see if I can’t get your support.

Fred seems happy to have a visitor.

FRED
Well, come on in. I’ll put on a pot of coffee.

He disappears inside. Leslie glances to camera and follows.

SPY SHOT: Tom watches one of his fleet, RANDY, eating one of his CANDY BARS. He chews, guiltily.

TOM
Randy! Come on, man! (he takes the bar)
Never eat the merch.

Tom gives each kid a SLICE OF BREAD.

TOM (CONT’D)
Here you go. Fill up the tank.

The kids eat the bread. Tom notices the camera. He groans. TOM TALKING HEAD
TOM
It’s the main problem with the business model. You give a kid candy to sell, he’s gonna be tempted. 
What’s the answer?
(holds up slice of white bread) Hundred calories, tons of carbs for that long-lasting power boost, 
and none of that healthy taste kids hate. Plus, it expands in their stomachs, so they fill up 
quick. For the huskier kids--
(holds up three stacked slices of white bread)
Bread sandwich. ANN AND MARK TALKING HEAD
ANN
So, it turns out we were basically drumming up opposition.

B-roll: Ann and Mark leaving various doors, indicating “no” to the camera, eventually slipping a 
flier under a door and quickly leaving.

ANN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Telling people about the project, then telling them exactly when and where they could complain 
about it.

Back on camera.

ANN (CONT’D)
Then we realized something that changed our game plan.

MARK
(pointing to the house they’re in front of)
That’s Ann’s house.

INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - D1

Ann shows Mark in. Andy is on the couch, playing ROCK BAND in boxers and an open flannel shirt. He 
doesn’t look up, intent on an expert-level guitar riff.

ANDY
(calling off)
Babe, someone at the door. Ann looks at Mark, then the camera.
ANN
Yeah, it’s me, honey. I wasn’t home.

ANDY
Oh, I thought you were in the bathroom or something.



All day?
ANN


ANDY
I know, right? I was like, “she’s taking awhile.”

Andy cranes his neck. Sees Mark. And the cameras.

MARK
Hello.

ANDY
Hey, man, what up? Lemme just pause this, so I don’t lose any fans.
(he pauses the game) Mork, right?

MARK
...Mark.

ANDY
That makes more sense. Right on.

Ann goes into the kitchen. As she does:

ANN
Hon, can you--

She indicates that Andy should cover up a little.

ANDY
Oh yeah. Sorry.

Andy reaches for the nearest thing -- a cereal box -- and places it over his crotch. It doesn’t do 
much.

Ann brings in glasses of ICED TEA. Mark sips his and sighs.

MARK
This is so much better than knocking on people’s doors.

ANN
Yeah.

ANDY
Hey, bro, you play Rock Band? Drums are wide open. I’d offer bass, but it got broken when I smashed 
it.

Mark looks at a FRACTURED, SMASHED ROCK BAND BASS on the floor.

MARK
I’m good, thanks.

ANDY
“I’m good” like you suck, or “I’m good” like you’re scared ‘cause I’m a professional musician and 
you’ll get crushed?
(then)
I’m just kidding you. (to Ann)
I like this guy!

MARK
And I like you! Ann looks a little unsure.
INT. FRED’S HOUSE - LATER - D1

Leslie and Fred drink coffee and eat little cookies.

LESLIE
...And that is why there is no better use for that lot. What’s more American than a park, Fred?

FRED
Leslie, it sounds like a good idea.

LESLIE
(starting to get up)
Great! Then I will see you tomorrow at the forum!

FRED
But I’m just not sure.

LESLIE
(sitting back down)
Okay. Which part makes you unsure?

FRED
Turning the pit into a park.

LESLIE
That’s... the whole thing.

FRED
Well, don’t get me wrong -- I’ve lived in this neighborhood my entire life.
Sullivan Street used to be a dirt road between two farms.

Leslie perks up.

FRED (CONT’D)
Heck, my wife grew up right near Ramsett Park, and we used to take our grandkids there...

Leslie glances at camera: this guy’s a catch! INT. ANN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 1
Andy plays Rock Band in the b.g., as Ann and Mark drink iced tea. Ann is on her cell PHONE, trying 
to cover the background noise as much as possible.

ANN
Wow -- Leslie, that sounds amazing. We’re, uh -- doing okay. Plugging away. Okay, we will. Yes, 
I’ll tell him.
(she hangs up)
Leslie says she’s got a “hot lead.” She also says “hi” and “what’s up” and “carry on.” ...Should I 
feel bad?

MARK
Do you feel bad?

ANN
Not really.

Then don’t. So, what’s your story?

ANN
What story?

MARK
You and Andy. How’d you meet? Gaming convention? You meet on-line? You guys play Xbox Live against 
each other?

She gives him a look.

ANN
No, we got set up by a girlfriend of mine.

MARK
Huh. What’d you do to her? He chuckles. Ann doesn’t. He stops.
ANN
Okay. Bye bye.

MARK
Come on. I’m kidding.

ANN
Bye, Mark. I’ll see you tomorrow.

She gets up and walks back into the LIVING ROOM and plops down next to Andy. Mark sits 
uncomfortably, trying to smile to the cameras a little.

ANDY
Hey, babe.

ANN
Hey. Let’s do “Gimme Shelter.” I’ll sing.

ANDY
Nice!

Mark gets up and makes his way awkwardly to the door.

MARK
(small) Bye, guys.

ANDY
Later, man.

INT. FRED’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Fred is fast asleep, his chest rising and falling. Leslie has dimmed the lights, and speaks quietly 
to not wake him up.

LESLIE
(to camera)
I’ve been here for four hours. I’m not leaving. I mean, it’s only 7:15. This has got to be a nap.
(quietly) Fred?
(louder) Fred?
(beat) Fire!
(beat)
He’ll wake up. He’s so close to saying “yes.”

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - STREET - LATER - N1

SPY SHOT: The kids gather around Tom, their ringmaster.

TOM
How we doing, guys? Everybody good?

DUKIE
I’m tired.

RANDY
Yeah, I got homework.

TOM
Come on, guys, it’s dinner time -- everybody’s home. Just give me one more good hour--

He sees the camera like: “C’mon! You guys are everywhere!”

TOM (CONT’D)
Okay, great work team. Head on home, you little scamps! God love ya!
(as they drag ass home) Stay in school!

INT. FRED’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

SPY SHOT: Camera looks through the window, into Fred’s living room. Fred is still asleep in the 
chair. And on the couch, curled up like a baby, is Leslie -- fast asleep.

ACT THREE

EXT. FRED’S HOUSE - VERY EARLY MORNING - DAY 2

Leslie, bedraggled, stumbles out of Fred’s house and looks around... disoriented...

EXT. PIONEER HALL - PARKING LOT - LATER - D2

Leslie pulls up and stumbles out of her car. INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - LATER - D2
Tom is at his desk. Leslie rushes in. She looks like she slept on a couch. Because she slept on a 
couch. She frantically searches piles on her desk.

LESLIE
Where’s my gavel?

TOM
You smell like old man.

LESLIE
Darn it!

Leslie looks around, opens a closet and grabs a BIG GREEN CAN. She sprays herself with it, like 
perfume.

TOM
Now you smell like old man and carpet.

LESLIE
Sub-committee meeting. Now.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - D2

Tom, Mark, and Ann sit around the table. Leslie presides.

LESLIE
Tom, how’d you do?

TOM
Five or six, that’s all.

LESLIE
Good for you. I only got a maybe.

TOM
Well, they might flake.

LESLIE
Mark, Ann?

Uh... I’m not sure we had anything definite.

LESLIE
It’s just so frustrating. We all worked really hard! We pounded that pavement non-stop, all day 
yesterday.

Mark tries to look at Ann. Ann can’t look at anyone. She glances at the camera, feeling terrible.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Well. Okay. Thanks everybody. I think the best thing would be: if we delay the forum for between 
one and ninety days.

ANN
You want to cancel the meeting?

LESLIE
Delay. Because I have strep throat.

ANN
You do? Let me see.

LESLIE
I don’t have strep throat.

MARK
You can’t cancel, Leslie. You sent out fliers; it was listed in the paper.
Those people are going to come.

LESLIE
(gaveling hard) Dammit!

Everyone jumps, reacts.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
What a mess.

INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - PERMITS DESK - LATER - D2

April sits behind the desk, handing out permit applications. Her attitude hasn’t changed, but the 
(short) line is moving smoothly. Ron wanders over.

RON
What’s going on, here?

Nobody answers. The machine continues smoothly.

Donna, who is at her desk reading a Richard North Patterson novel, sighs and takes April’s place 
behind the desk.

APRIL
But I figured it out.

RON
(annoyed) Yeah. I know.

APRIL TALKING HEAD

APRIL
They go, “I need permit whatever” and I give them one from the whatever box. Then they’re like, no, 
the pink one, so I give them the pink one, and they’re like, “thanks,” and then the next person 
comes up.
(then)
I was kind of a superstar.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - NIGHT 2

PAN ACROSS people in the crowd, including Kate, who looks like she can’t wait to get up and yell.

UP ON THE DAIS -- Out of view of the auditorium, Leslie nervously talks to camera.

LESLIE
(to camera)
This might be just fine. Maybe the nay- sayers changed their minds overnight.

Leslie nervously peeks out as PEOPLE file into the room. She pulls back, aghast.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Omigod. Omigod. My mom is here.

ANGLE ON Marlene in the front row, looking around crankily.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
(happy, despite herself) My mom is here.
(wait: fuck) My mom is here.

Listen, I want to apologize--

ANN

She walks off. Mark stares after her. MARK TALKING HEAD
MARK
Yeah, I patched things up with Ann. So, I guess we’re back to being... acquaintances.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER - N2

There’s a relatively large crowd. They don’t seem happy. Leslie speaks into a microphone.

LESLIE
Good evening. My name is Deputy Director of the Parks and Recreation Department Leslie Knope. Thank 
you for coming to our very first public forum about our proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street 
into a community park. Yeah!!

Nothing from the audience. Leslie glances nervously to camera. Marlene notices and looks to camera, 
too.

MARLENE TALKING HEAD

MARLENE
This is going to be a train wreck.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS - N2

LESLIE
I will now open the floor for comments.

Kate JUMPS UP (as do a few other PEOPLE) and goes to the mic in the aisle.

KATE
Hello. My name is Kate Spivak, and I want to say that I am firmly, one hundred percent against this 
park. I think it would be bad for the community, and there are hundreds of better uses for that 
space.

Many people in the crowd APPLAUD. Leslie looks scared. This is off to a terrible start. Leslie gets 
back behind the microphone.

LESLIE
Okay, thank you for your comments. Before we continue, I’d just like to give you a little history. 
The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, after Reverend Luther Howell of Terre Haute traveled 
one hundred miles by ox and planted a flag in the ground, before being twisted to death by a small 
band of Wamapoke Indians.

LESLIE TALKING HEAD

LESLIE
Yes, uh, Democracy does mean hearing the public’s opinion. But Advanced Democracy also has dozens 
of loopholes built in.
One of those is: the filibuster. You just keep talking, and nobody can do anything ‘til you stop.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER - N2

It’s been a while. People are getting antsy. Marlene looks impressed and proud.

LESLIE
...leading to the massive raccoon problem we still enjoy today.
(taking out a book)
Now let’s take a magical journey through a little thing I like to call: “The Phantom Tollbooth,” by 
Norton Juster.

MAN IN CROWD
Excuse me? Can’t you read that children’s book on your own time?

LESLIE
(snaps)
I have the floor!
(she begins to read)
“There was once a boy named Milo...”

This is supposed to be a public forum. That means the public talks, and you listen.

Leslie sees Fred in the crowd. She brightens.

LESLIE
Okay. Yes. You are right. Let’s start with that gentleman, right there.

Fred looks slightly surprised, but makes his way to the microphone.

LESLIE (CONT’D)
Go ahead, sir.

FRED
Well, my name is Fred Tessop. I’ve lived in Pawnee all my life.

LESLIE
All your life, wow. I am going to listen to you. Continue.

FRED
I remember when I was a young boy, I used to go feed the birds in Ramsett Park. I do feel strongly 
that Pawnee would benefit from a new park, so my grandchildren and their children can feed birds 
for years to come.

The crowd seems touched. Leslie looks incredibly relieved.

LESLIE
Thank you, sir. A moving tribute to my proposal.

FRED
(to crowd)
I would also point out that I did not feel this way yesterday. But that young lady speaking up 
there had so much passion for the project, she spent the night with me.

The crowd REACTS.



Whoooooa!

Ann stands up.

ANN
Okay, wait... hang on. Hi, everyone. My name is Ann Perkins, and I’m a Pawnee citizen just like 
you. I live right next to that pit, and I’d like to say for the record: I also fully support Ms. 
Knope’s proposal to turn it into a park. And you know what? It seems like she’s working really hard 
to try to get something done, and make the neighborhood better, and I think we should respect that.

Leslie is tremendously moved. She and Ann smile at each other.

KATE
(to Ann)
Aren’t you the one who came to my door with her yesterday?

ANN
(caught)
Uh--

KATE
Oh my God! They brought audience plants!

The crowd responds.

KATE (CONT’D)
Most of us think this park is a bad idea, so why don’t we take a vote!

People APPLAUD. Mark looks around. He jumps up and goes to Leslie.

LESLIE
Water!

Mark gives her his bottled water which she gulps as he talks.

MARK
(quietly)
Don’t let them vote -- even unofficially, if it goes on the record it’s terrible for us.

Leslie smiles wanly and nods.

Okay. Okay, everyone. This woman was right when she said we should hear what everyone has to say. 
So, please, everyone who wishes to speak, line up at the microphones.

away.

Intercut with shots of Leslie sitting quietly and nodding, Ann and Mark looking exasperated, and 
Tom happily reading The Phantom Tollbooth.

Normally, I don’t agree with Leslie about anything.

But this book is amazing! INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - LATER - N2
Leslie looks really intent and concentrated.

COMPLAINING MAN
--used to live next to a park. You can’t park in front of your house on the weekends, because of

Tom exits, a smile on his face. A MOTHER approaches him. She’s not smiling.

them away from the camera.
